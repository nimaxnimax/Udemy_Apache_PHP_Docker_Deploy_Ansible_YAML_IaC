What is IaC and Ansible YAML?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a methodology that involves managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable script files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. IaC allows IT teams to define, version, and automate the deployment and configuration of infrastructure components using code. This approach enhances consistency, repeatability, and collaboration while reducing manual errors.

Ansible YAML refers to the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) syntax used in Ansible playbooks and roles. Ansible, being an automation tool, employs YAML to define tasks, configurations, and roles in a human-readable format. YAML is well-suited for Ansible because of its simplicity and readability, making it accessible to both developers and system administrators. Ansible YAML files, known as playbooks, describe the desired state of the system and the tasks required to achieve that state, allowing users to automate complex infrastructure operations efficiently.

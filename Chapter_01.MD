What is Ansible and Why using Ansible?

Ansible is an open-source automation tool that facilitates configuration management, application deployment, and task orchestration in IT environments. It uses a simple, human-readable language (YAML) to define automation tasks and configurations, making it accessible to both beginners and experienced users. Ansible operates agentlessly, relying on SSH or WinRM for communication, which eliminates the need for installing agents on managed systems. The tool supports idempotent operations, ensuring that running the same playbook multiple times produces consistent results. Key benefits of using Ansible include its simplicity, extensibility, scalability, and the ability to manage infrastructure as code, promoting automation and streamlining IT operations. Ansible's widespread adoption is attributed to its versatility, ease of use, and effectiveness in managing complex infrastructure configurations across diverse environments.
